Once upon a time there was a guy who drank water and lived in a house.
He then decided to go out of his house for a breath of fresh air.
Next thing he knew, he was standing besides a man who coughed on him.
This resulted in him contracting the coronavirus.
He soon died of acute pneumonia.

Lucky for him and those around, he lived in a small house at the top of a mountain. He tended to keep to himself and work on various woodworking projects. His latest was a canoe that was propped up in the garage, ready to be painted. Unfortunately, due to his lonely nature, no one noticed the man was dead until a week after it happened.

Unfortunately, after finding out the man's body, people got infected and the village located under that mountain had to be quarantined
